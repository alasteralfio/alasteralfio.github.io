                            <p>
                            Mastermind is a classic board game that I ported to the Command Line. This game was built using
                            Python, and was one of my first projects in the language. In my version, the player can customize
                            the settings extensively, selecting options like duplicates, sequence length, etc.

                            <h2>Purpose</h2>
                            <p>
                            This game was made as a final submission to one of my Python Courses, and we were given the
                            freedom to come up with any project we wanted. I chose to make Mastermind, as I wanted to
                            challenge myself with a board game, but not one that everyone else would've done before.

                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-6">
                        <div class="content-box">
                            <h2>Process</h2>
                            <p>
                            This all started with understanding the game. I briefly played Mastermind in the past, but
                            in order to code the full game, I needed to understand the rules and the logic behind it.<br><br>
                            I then started coding the game, starting with the menu so I could understand where things 
                            were going. Afterwards, I began coding the actual game. This did take quite a bit of trial
                            and error, as it was one of my first Python projects, but I eventually got it. <br><br>
                            after I finished the game itself, I wanted to push myself further so I looked through the
                            code and decided that there were a ton of different variables that could be left up to the
                            user to configure. Moreover, I wanted the game to look good, despite being just a CLI game,
                            therefore I used an ASCII logo for the main menu. Moreover, the UI for the game itself was 
                            designed to be more aesthetically pleasing than just a bunch of text.<br><br>
