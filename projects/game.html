                            Built in GameMaker Studio 2, this project includes retro classics like Asteroids, Pong,
                            Atari Breakout, and Snake. All the games were custom designed and coded in GML Code.

                            <p>
                            With the rise of alternative game engines like Godot and GameMaker, I wanted to try my
                            hands on one of them, having only experience on Unity. I chose GameMaker Studio 2 as it
                            was a popular choice for 2D games, and has many available resources.

                            <h2>Process</h2>
                            <p>
                            I first started with deciding what game to make. Pong and Snake were games I had in my
                            generation growing up, so I wanted to pay tribute to my nostalgic beginnings. I then
                            decided on Asteroids and Atari Breakout, as though they were just outside my generation,
                            they were still classics that many people felt nostalgic about.<br><br>
                            From there, I started with Asteroids by following a simple tutorial from the GameMaker
                            website. It was a great way to understand basic concepts. At first, I didn't understand
                            the reason behind certain choices GameMaker developers made, such as using key events
                            instead of reading key inputs from the step event. But as I progressed, I understood
                            the importance of these choices.<br><br>
                            After Asteroids, I moved on to Pong, which was a bit more challenging. I had to understand
                            how to make the ball bounce off the paddles and walls, and how to make the paddles move.
                            Moving the paddles were easy enough, and I discovered the use of the clamp function, which
                            prevents the paddles from moving out of bounds. The ball bouncing was quitea challenge,
                            as I had to understand basic math concepts to calclate the ball bounce trajectories. The
                            last part of Pong was the AI opponent, which was easy enough. I simply made the AI follow
                            the ball's X position, and locked it to a set movement speed slightly slower than the player's.<br><br>
                            Atari Breakout was next. This was by far the easiest to code aside from the Asteroids tutorial
                            I followed. I already had the paddle movement and the ball bounce mechanics, so all I had to do
                            was code the tiles to break once the ball hit them. <br><br>
                            Finally, I moved on to Snake. This was the most challenging of the four games, as I had to
                            understand how to make the snake grow when it eats the apple, and how to make the snake
                            move in the direction the player inputs. I also had to make sure the snake didn't collide
                            with itself, which was a challenge in itself. I had to understand how to make the snake
                            move in a grid, and how to make the snake grow in the direction it was moving. All in all,
                            it was a great learning journey with many, many, many trial and errors.<br><br>
                            The collection will be released on itch.io soon, so stay tuned!
