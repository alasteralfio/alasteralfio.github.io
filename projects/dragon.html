                            Made in Blender, this model features a high-quality, exact to scale dragon playground found
                            in the deepest parts of our childhood in Singapore.

                            <p>
                            With very little prior experience in Blender, I wanted to work on this project to improve my
                            skills in the software. I chose the dragon playground as it is a very iconic part of Singapore's
                            history, and I wanted to recreate it in a 3D model. Moreover, a quick search online showed that
                            there were very few 3D models of the playground, and none that were free, so I decided to make
                            one myself.
                            </p>

                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-6">
                        <div class="content-box">
                            <h2>Process</h2>
                            <p>
                            This began with a lot of research on the playground, as I wanted to make sure that the model
                            was as accurate as possible. I spent a full day looking for references, and thankfully, I was
                            able to find a scale blueprint of the full playground, which became my foundation for everything.
                            <br><br>
                            I then started modelling the playground, working on just the front face at first. This in itself
                            took a ton of time, as with my inexperience in blender, my meshes looked horrible. <br><br>
                            After redoing
                            it 4 times or so, I was finally satisfied with my work. I then went on to work on the sides and
                            back, which were much easier to do, as I had already gotten the hang of the software, and all
                            I had to do was copy and paste the same elements.
