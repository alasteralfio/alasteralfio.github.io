                            Upbringing is a VR Game built in Unity, with compatibility for the HTC Vive platform in mind.
                            The game uses Unity's VR Interaction Toolkit and is coded in C#, and all 2D assets were custom
                            made in Photoshop and GIMP.

                            <p>
                            Originally, I planned to build this game for a school assignment. As time went on through the
                            development process, I slowly fell in love with the game and decided to put in my all.<br><br>
                            This game takes place in a haunted toy house, a representation of a twisted past and a traumatic
                            childhood. The player must navigate these horrors, avoiding Mother, the antagonist, and solving
                            puzzles to escape.

                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-6">
                        <div class="content-box">
                            <h2>Process</h2>
                            <p>
                            Firstly, I started out with working on the lighting in my scene. I knew I wanted a darker
                            atmosphere, with lighting that feels intentional. Through the help of many youtube videos,
                            I finally got the lighting I wanted.<br><br>
                            Afterwards, I began sketching the room layouts, deciding the puzzles, and the overall flow
                            of the game. I wanted to make sure the player felt a sense of dread and urgency as they
                            navigated the house.<br><br>
                            Finally, I began working on the assets. All of the 2D assets, such as the walls, floors,
                            manequeins, and other smaller props were created entirely by me in Photoshop. The manequeins' poses
                            were sketched out beforehand, albeit very roughly, and the symbols on them were freestyled
                            on the spot, with reference to Minecraft's iconic "Enchantment Table" symbols.<br><br>
                            The 3D assets, such as the doors, the key, and the flashlight, were all downloaded from
                            the Unity Asset Store, and consequently modified to fit the game's aesthetic.<br><br>
                            Once all the game's visuals were done, it was time to begin the coding. This process took
                            the most time by far, as I had to code the AI for the chasing manequeins, the randomization
                            for the poses and the symbols, and the final puzzle, Simon Says. The Simon Says puzzle
                            took the longest to code, as I had to make sure the randomization actually worked, and the
                            sequence was saved to a variable to be checked against the player's input.<br><br>
                            Finally, I added the finishing touches like sound, particle effects, and some post processing
                            on the lighting. <br><br>
