                            My name card, designed in Illustrator and Photoshop, features a minimalist design with a
                            focus on typography. The card is double-sided, with the front featuring my logo, and
                            the back featuring my contact information.

                            Originally, this was made for a class project, though as I worked more on it, I realized that
                            I could use it as my own name card. I wanted to create a design that was simple yet elegant,
                            and I believe that I have achieved that with this design.

                            <h2>Process</h2>
                            <p>
                            This project was made in Illustrator and Photoshop. I started by sketching out some ideas
                            on paper, and then moved on to creating the design in Illustrator. <br><br>
                            I came across some images featuring a name card that looked like an ID, and I was inspired
                            by that design. I decided to make my name card look like a mini ID card, with my logo on
                            the back. I didn't want just another basic name card though, so I decided to play around
                            with the perspectives of the information to the right of the card image. <br><br>
                            I decided to put my contact information on a wall tilting away from the user. Gettinng the
                            perspective of the room was difficult, although I soon found a brilliant solution. I went
                            onto Minecraft, a classic game that I had played in my childhood, and built a replica room.
                            By using this room. I was able to get the angles for the corner of each wall just rght. <br><br>
                            I then went on to place my text on the wall, and with the help of perspective warp and some
                            quick touches, I was done! All in all, this project taught me more about Illustrator, and
                            it also encouraged me to think outside the box. What other games can I use as a tool for
                            my designs?
